# Digital Twin Oil Well Monitor

This project implements a real-time oil well monitoring system using Unity 3D as the front end and ESP8266 as the backend. It collects temperature data and uses MQTT to send sensor values to the digital twin. Machine learning models predict maintenance needs to prevent equipment failure.

## Technologies Used
- ESP8266
- DS18B20 Temperature Sensor
- MQTT (Mosquitto)
- Unity 3D (for Digital Twin)
- Python + TensorFlow (Decision Tree Model)

## Features
- Real-time sensor monitoring
- Predictive maintenance alerts
- Control motor speed (low, medium, high)
- 3D visualization with Unity

## Applications
- Oil and gas industry
- Remote asset monitoring
- Industrial IoT (IIoT)
